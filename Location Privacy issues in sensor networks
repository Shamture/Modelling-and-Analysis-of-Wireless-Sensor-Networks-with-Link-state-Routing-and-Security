Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) in various sensitive areas such as health-care, military, habitat monitoring, etc, the need to ensure security and privacy is becoming imperatively important. For example, in battlefield application scenario, “the location of a soldier should not be exposed if he initiates broadcast query”. In the meantime, query must be transferred to the destination in an encrypted manner via only trusted en-route nodes. Similarly, in habitat monitoring application scenarios, such as Great Duck Island  or Save-the-panda application  where large numbers of sensor nodes are deployed to observe the vast habitat of ducks and pandas, an adversary can try to capture the panda or duck by back-tracing the routing path until it reaches the source sensor nodes. Therefore, in order to prevent the adversary from back-tracing, the route, and location and data privacy mechanisms must be enforced. With respect to these application scenarios, network level privacy has often been categorized into four categories:

•	Sender node identity privacy: no intermediate node can get any information about who is sending the packets except the source, its immediate neighbours and the destination,
•	Sender node location privacy: no intermediate node can have any information about the location (in terms of physical distance or number of hops) about the sender node except the source, its immediate neighbours and the destination.
•	Route privacy: no node can predict the information about the complete path (from source to destination). Also, a mobile adversary gets no clue to trace back the source node either from the contents and/or directional information of the captured packet(s).
•	Data packet privacy: no node can see the information inside in a payload of the data packet except the source and the destination.

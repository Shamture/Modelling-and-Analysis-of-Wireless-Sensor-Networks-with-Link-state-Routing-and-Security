The objective of our project is to demonstrate Alternate Path Routing (APR) with respect to Link State Routing Protocol using JAVA and J2ME simulations. Next, we have to provide detailed simulations of our proposed basic and secure routing protocols in order to illustrate full Identity, Route, Location and Data Privacy. An algorithm for full network level security needs to be designed.
